# SalesForce REST Api PHP client

Salesforce/Force.com REST API PHP client. While it acts as more of a wrapper of the API methods, it should provide you with all the flexibility you will need to interact with the Salesforce REST api.
This component is based on documentation available [here](https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/sfdc/pdf/api_rest.pdf)

## Installation

```bash
composer require "aracoool/salesforce-client:^1.0"
